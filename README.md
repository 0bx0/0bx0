### Robotics & Embedded Systems | BITS Pilani Goa
I’m an undergraduate in EEE + Biological Sciences at BITS Pilani Goa, and most of what I build lives on real hardware. My projects are a mix of robotics, embedded systems, and small experimental tools I throw on GitHub for quality of life. If there's something that can be automated, I will automate it.

Recently, I’ve been working on autonomous navigation and perception:

- Built a Jetson-powered perception stack using YOLO11 for detecting environmental features in real time on low-power hardware.  
- Wrote Python drivers to interface LIDAR and camera modules for autonomous decision-making.  
- Managed embedded Linux deployments and scripted telemetry + reliability tooling. 
- Working on GPS-independent UGV navigation that combines SLAM and deep learning for mapping and decisions.
  
Outside robotics, I occasionally publish small utilities or experiments:
- A mess-menu PWA for BITS Goa with offline support and automated Python-based deployment. 
- UI/UX design work for institute fest apps.
- Random scripts, prototypes.

Before all this, I spent two years doing QA for Opera GX—finding UI bugs, edge cases, and performance issues and writing structured technical reports for the engineering team. 

Most of my stuff here is messy and cluttered, I push random stuff I made without expecting anything.
